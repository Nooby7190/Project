                        <p>What are the environmental consequences of computer device production?</p>
                        <a>The consequences of computer manufacturing is that it causes recycling problems since the materials of a computer are hard to recycle which causes them to be thrown into landfills. This can cause many issues such as the hazardous substances inside of the computers along with valuable resources that could be in the computer
			Manufacturing a computer could also lead to green house gas as when manufacturing a computer it requires many materials and those materials cause tons of carbon oxide which create green house gas</a>
	
                	<p>What are the negative effects of computer device disposal?</p>
                        <a>Soil and water contamination as electirons are placed into land fields it could infect the water with the chemicals that are inside of the computer if the computers are disposed inproperly it could infect the soil as well as it would seep into the soil creating contaminated soil that cannot be used. 
			Burning devices would lead to chemicals being released into the air creating air pollination which would overall cause problems for us such as health risk and dangers to wildlife.</a>
	
                        <p>How does computer use harm the environment?</p>
                        <a>Computers that come with plastic, styroform and cardboard are dangerous to the enivormental if not disposed of properly which is the case as improper disposedment causes pollution and those materials takes hundreds of years to be disposed of. 
			Computers have short-lifespans which cause consumers to purschase a better computer or device which contributed to e-waste causing dangers to the environment such as contaminated soil and water also harming the eco system.</a>
