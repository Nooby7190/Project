                        <a>We should start reusing the amount of materials inside of the computers instead of throwing them out into landfills as we could use metals inside of the computer such as copper which would benefit as It wouldn't cause that much carbon missions or green house gasses.</a>
	
                        <p>What are some ways to reduce the environmental impact of computer use?</p>
                        <a>Looking for sustainable hardware would benefit the environmental such as Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool which selects your computer based off your environmental attributes or computers that would consume less energy. This would just help the lifespan of your computer.</a>
	
                        <p>How can we minimize the impact of computer device disposal on the environment?</p>
                        <a>Switching over to renewable energy sourcs such as solar or wind energy  when manufacturing computers as this would lower carbon emissions rates.
			Designing the computers so that their more durable and repairabitlies so that replacements would be much easier this would just improve the lifepsan of computers making it so that the amount of e-waste that is thrown into landfills are reduced.</a>
